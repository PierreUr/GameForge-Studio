# Changelog - GameForge Studio

## [1.27.0]
- **[TASK-177]** [FEAT] Implemented a responsive layout system. Users can now switch between Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile views in the UI Editor. Each view saves its own unique layout, allowing for device-specific designs.
- **[TASK-177]** [REFACTOR] Overhauled the project saving and loading mechanism to correctly handle and persist both the UI layout structure and the underlying ECS entity state for each responsive view.
